SilvaExternalSources changes

  0.9.2

    Bugs fixed:

     o The layout pagetemplate for rendering the SQL result set now gets more 
       information about the columns names and their order. The pagetemplates
       of existing SQL Source instances need to be updated to make use
       of this information.

  0.9.1

    Features added:

     o Silva 1.1 compatibility.

    Bugs fixed:

     o Added support for default values in the Kupu editor tool.

  0.9

    Features added:

      o XML exporter for external source-based data in
        documents. Needed to support Silva's XSLT rendering.

  0.8

    Bugs fixed:

      o Configure the correct "add" permissions (esp. for
        CSV Sources)

  0.8b1

    Features added:
     
      o Kupu support.

    Bugs fixed:

      o The description could not be set empty. It can now.

      o The ZMI screens for the ExternalSource objects are now set
        to be in utf-8. This way we can make save assumption for
        decoding the user input into unicode.

  0.7

    Lots of additions and bugfixes, including new CVSSource object.
 
  0.2 
 
    Initial public release.
