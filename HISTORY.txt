SilvaExternalSources changes

  0.8b1

    Features added:
     
      o Kupu support.

    Bugs fixed:

      o The description could not be set empty. It can now.

      o The ZMI screens for the ExternalSource objects are now set
        to be in utf-8. This way we can make save assumption for
        decoding the user input into unicode.

  0.7

    Lots of additions and bugfixes, including new CVSSource object.
 
  0.2 
 
    Initial public release.
