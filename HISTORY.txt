  2.1.1 (08/05/2009):

    Bugs Fixed:

      - Code Sources: MultiListField values were being passed to the
        rendering script as strings instead of lists

  2.1:

    Features Added:

      - added install_codesources function to install codesources
        from the file system.

      - english 'translation' was missing.

  2.0.9:

    Bugs Fixed:

      - html entered into parameters is no lounger doubly escaped on
        saving the document.

  2.0.7:

    Features Added:

      - added support for 'elaborate' code sources, that show their
        add/edit form in a pop-up instead of in the kupu
        toolbox. Useful when code sources have a large number of
        variables.

      - component registration now done using Silva 2.0 zcml
        directives SilvaExternalSources no longer works with Silva 1.6
        or lower

    Bugs Fixed:

      - SilvaExternalSources now depends on SilvaDocument (in
        configure.zcml) since attempting to add this product will fail
        if SilvaDocument isn't installed.

      - fixed sql source "show caption" and "show table column
        headings" parameters

      - problem with checkboxfields (checked) when rendering a code
        source

      - #106231 Integer field of Code Sources cannot be empty Empty
        Integer fields now have a value of None

      - #180860 code source parameter ids must be lowercase They can
        now be mixed case.  However, multiple parameters with ids that
        differ only in case aren't supported

  1.5:

    Bugs Fixed:

      - the model is available in validate_to_form (when working from kupu)

  1.4

    Features added / bugs fixed: not recorded

  1.3

    Features added:

      - Updated to work with Zope 2.10

  1.2

    Features added:

      - Users get confused when adding a Code Source that has no
        parameters.  They have to click the same button twice, once to
        add, and again to add.  Added a note that informs the user how
        to proceed.

    Bugs fixed:

      - The add form for CSV Sources was broken in that it ignored the
        file upload field.

      - CheckBox parameters in Code Sources now work as expected.
        (Thanks Benno!)

  0.13

    Features added:

      - Changed Silva External Sources to use new i18n machinery.

      - Available code sources are sorted on title when presented as a list.

    Bugs fixed:

      - Titles were not stored as unicode strings.
        Moved the setting of the title to *after* the creation
        of the source, so that we can get an encoding from somewhere
        and use it to convert to unicode. Unfortunately this somewhere is a
        hard coded string for now, since Zope 2 doesn't seem to allow
        anything else.

      - ZMI parameter forms are now utf-8 by default.

      - Fixed unicode bug when using non-ascii chars in field titles (Kupu
        specific, port from 0.10 branch).

  0.12

    Bugs fixed:

      - Fixes to security declarations to stop Zope 2.8.5+ startup warnings.

      - Some HTML template cleanups.

      - Import registerDirectory from Silva's fssite.

  0.11

    Features added:

      - Silva 1.5 (Zope 2.8) compatibility fixes.

  0.10.3

    Bugs fixed:

      - Fixed unicode bug in SQL statement, this didn't support non-ascii
        characters yet.

      - Fixed conditionals in the layout template, setting 'show_caption' and
        'show_column_heading' should now have an effect.

  0.10.2:

    Bugs fixed:

      - Fixed typo in add_submit script for CSVSource.

      - Fixed issue1257, context problems in Kupu, Kupu code now uses the same code
        to find code sources as the rest of Silva.

  0.10.1

    Bugs fixed:

     o Fixed missing import for Silva.i18n.translate

  0.10

    Features added:

     o i18n, German translation.

    Bugs fixed:

     o The layout pagetemplate for rendering the SQL result set now
       gets more information about the columns names and their
       order. The pagetemplates of existing SQL Source instances need
       to be updated to make use of this information.

  0.9.1

    Features added:

     o Silva 1.1 compatibility.

    Bugs fixed:

     o Added support for default values in the Kupu editor tool.

  0.9

    Features added:

      o XML exporter for external source-based data in
        documents. Needed to support Silva's XSLT rendering.

  0.8

    Bugs fixed:

      o Configure the correct "add" permissions (esp. for
        CSV Sources)

  0.8b1

    Features added:

      o Kupu support.

    Bugs fixed:

      o The description could not be set empty. It can now.

      o The ZMI screens for the ExternalSource objects are now set
        to be in utf-8. This way we can make save assumption for
        decoding the user input into unicode.

  0.7

    Lots of additions and bugfixes, including new CVSSource object.

  0.2

    Initial public release.
