SilvaExternalSources provide a facility to Silva allowing (rendered)
data generated by an external source to be included inside Silva
Documents.

Included is a CodeSource to include the result of arbitrary Python
code, a SQL Source to include the result of a SQL query as a table, and
a CSV Source (with Silva UI) to include a CSV file as a table.
