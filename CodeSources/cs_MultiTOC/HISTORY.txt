Silva Multi-TOC Code Source changes

0.5

  Features added

    - Renamed Code Source id to conform with 'cs_' prefix
    
    - Improved public/private field description. 

0.4

  Features added

    - Removed a local style in the first containter heading and replaced it 
      with class="interheading", so users can control the spacing between it
      and the capsule heading or the surrounding div.

  Bugs fixed

    - Editable documents were not showing up because get_public_tree was always
      being called. Now the template code checks the public_only variable and 
      calls get_tree if editable docs should be listed. 

    - In sort_tree the alphabetic sorting on title now uses get_title_editable.

0.3

  Features added

    - Added lookup field so authors get the path syntax right. To get multiple
      paths you can use it more than once with a little cut and paste.

    - Added an on-error so that authors who somehow typo the path don't get an
      "External source is broken" error message when (pre)viewing the rendered 
      document. Thanks to Irene at WU Wien for the tip. Users can edit the 
      error message on line 22 of multi_toc. You can have it fail silently by
      making the errormessage nothing.

0.2

  Features added

    - Moved some global defines out of the loop and into the initiation.

    - Added sort by folder order, alphabetic by title, modification date, or 
      creation date. The work is done by a Python script, sort_tree.

    - Added the option to reverse the order of the listing, because 
      assets seem to be listed backwards.

0.1

    - Initial public release.

0.1a

    - Initial development.
